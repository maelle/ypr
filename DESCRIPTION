Title: Yield Per Recruit
Description: An implementation of equilibrium-based 
    yield per recruit methods.
    The yield can be based on the number of fish caught (or harvested) or 
    biomass caught (or harvested) for 
    all fish or just large (trophy) individuals.
    The yield (and optimal capture rate) can be calculated with 
    lower and upper limits that represent the uncertainty in 
    one or more population parameters.

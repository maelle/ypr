Description: An implementation of equilibrium-based yield per recruit
    methods.  Yield per recruit methods can used to estimate the optimal
    yield for a fish population as described by Walters and Martell (2004)
    <isbn:0-691-11544-3>.  The yield can be based on the number of fish
    caught (or harvested) or biomass caught for all fish or just large
    (trophy) individuals.

Title: Yield Per Recruit for Recreational Fisheries
Description: An implementation of yield per recruit methods for 
    recreational fisheries in R.
    Given a list of life history parameters it can generate a data frame
    of the schedule and find the capture rate which maximises the yield. 
    The yield can be based on the total biomass vs number of fish; 
    harvested vs captured and large versus all fish.

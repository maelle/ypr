## Introduction

[`ypr`](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/ypr) is an R package that implements equilibrium-based yield per recruit methods.
Yield per recruit methods can used to estimate the optimal yield for a fish population [@walters_fisheries_2004].
The yield can be based on the number of fish caught (or harvested) or biomass for all fish or just large (trophy) individuals.

The key life history parameters are

- The growth coefficient (`k`) and mean maximum length (`Linf`) from the Von Bertalanffy growth curve
- The length at which 50% mature (`Ls`)
- The length at which 50% vulnerable to harvest (`Lv`)
- The interval annual natural mortality rate (`n`)
- The lifetime number of spawners per spawner at low density (`Rk`)

The calculations do not account for stochasticity, predator-prey dynamics, angler responses or density-dependent growth.

## Demonstration

### Schedule

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library(ypr)
population <- ypr_population(Rk = 5, Ls = 50, Rmax = 100, rho = 0.6)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, x = "Length", y = "Spawning")
head(ypr_tabulate_schedule(population))
```

### Fish

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ypr_plot_fish(population, color = "white")
head(ypr_tabulate_fish(population))
```

### Stock-Recruitment

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ypr_plot_sr(population)
ypr_tabulate_sr(population)
```

### Yield

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
ypr_tabulate_yield(population)
ypr_plot_yield(population)
```

### Uncertainty

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
library(ggplot2)
populations <- ypr_populations(Rk = c(3, 7), Ls = c(40, 60), Rmax = 100)
ypr_plot_yield(populations, plot_values = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(Rk ~ Ls)
```

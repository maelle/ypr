#' Exploitation Probability
#'
#' Converts capture probabilities into exploitation probabilities based on the
#' release and handling mortality probabilities where
#' the probability of exploitation includes handling mortalities.
#' The calculation assumes that a released fish cannot be recaught in the same year.
#'
#' In the case of no release (or 100% handling mortalities) the exploitation probability
#' is identical to the capture probability.
#' Otherwise it is less.
#'
#' @inheritParams ypr_schedule
#' @param pi A vector of capture probabilities to calculate the exploitation probabilities for.
#' @return A vector of exploitation probabilities.

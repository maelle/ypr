\usage{
ypr_plot_histogram(population, x = "Age", y = "Surviving",
  binwidth = NULL, color = "white")
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{An object of class \code{\link{ypr_population}}.}

\item{x}{A string of the term on the x-axis.}

\item{y}{A string of the term on the y-axis.}

\item{binwidth}{The width of the bins. Can be specified as a numeric value,
or a function that calculates width from x.
The default is to use \code{bins}
bins that cover the range of the data. You should always override
this value, exploring multiple widths to find the best to illustrate the
stories in your data.

The bin width of a date variable is the number of days in each time; the
bin width of a time variable is the number of seconds.}

\item{color}{A string of the color around each bar.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.

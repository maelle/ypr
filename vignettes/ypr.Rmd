## Introduction

> Fish are born, they grow, they reproduce and they die – whether from natural causes or from fishing. 
That’s it. 
Modelers just use complicated (or not so complicated) math to iron out the details.

Equilibrium based yield per recruit methods [@walters_fisheries_2004] estimate the capture rate that optimizes the yield under the assumption that there is no stochasticity and all density-dependence is captured by the stock-recruitment relationship. The remaining population processes of growth, reproduction and death are captured through a series of relatively straight-forward deterministic equations.

## Growth

### Length

In `ypr` length (in cm) at age ($t$) is assumed to follow a Von Bertalanffy growth curve

$$L = L_{\infty} \cdot (1 - \exp(-k \cdot (t-t_0)))$$

```{r}
library(ypr)
population <- ypr_population(Linf = 100, k = 0.2, t0 = 0)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Age", "Length")
```

### Weight

The weight ($W$) at a given length is assumed to follow the classic allometric relationship

$$W = w_\alpha \cdot L^{w_\beta}$$

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Wa = 0.01, Wb = 3)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "Weight")
```

Its worth noting that $w_\alpha$, which is the extrapolated weight (g) of a 1 cm individual, is a scaling constant that only affects the estimate of the yield (when calculated in terms of the biomass), ie, it does not affect the estimate of the optimal capture rate.

## Reproduction

### Fecundity

The fecundity ($F$) is assumed to scale allometrically with the weight according to the equation

$$F = f_\alpha \cdot W^{f_\beta}$$

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, fa = 1, fb = 1)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Weight", "Fecundity")
```

$f_\alpha$, which is the extrapolated eggs produced by a 1 g female, is a scaling constant with no effect on the yield or optimal capture rate.

### Spawning

The probability of spawning at length $L$ is determined by the equation

$$S = \frac{L^{S_p}}{L_s^{S_p} + L^{S_p}} \cdot es$$

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Ls = 50, Sp = 10, es = 0.8)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "Spawning")
```

## Death

### Natural Mortality

The annual interval natural mortality rate is assumed to vary by length according to the equation

$$ N = 1 - \exp(-M \cdot L^{M_\beta})$$
```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, M = 0.2, Mb = -0.5)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "NaturalMortality")
```

where $M$ is the annual instantaneous natural mortality rate.

The natural mortality rate can also be affected by spawning mortality

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Sm = 0.5)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "NaturalMortality")
```

### Fishing Mortality

The vulnerability to capture ($V$) is assumed to vary by length as follows

$$V = \frac{L^{V_p}}{L_v^{V_p} + L^{V_p}}$$

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Lv = 50, Vp = 50)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "Vulnerability")
```

If $V_p$ is 100 then vulnerability is effectively knife-edged.

The probabilty of being retained if captured ($R$) depends on the release rate ($\rho$), the slot limits ($L_{lo}$ and $L_{up}$) and the non-compliance with the limits ($N_c$)

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, rho = 0.5, Llo = 40, Lup = 70, Nc = 0.1)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "Retention")
```

The fishing mortality ($U$) depends on $V$, $R$ and the probability of capture when fully vulnerable ($pi$) as well as the hooking mortality ($H_m$)

$$U =  V \cdot \pi \cdot  R +  V \cdot \pi \cdot (1 - R) \cdot H_m$$

The calculation assumes that a released fish cannot be recaught in the same year.

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, pi = 0.3, Hm = 0.2)
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Length", "FishingMortality")
```

## Recruitment

With growth, reproduction and death defined, the final task is to estimate the recruitment (birth) rate.

This requires the number of spawners per spawner at low density ($R_k$) and the recruitment age ($R_t$; by default 1) to be defined.

If recruitment follows a Beverton-Holt ($BH = 1$) curve then

$$R = \alpha \cdot S / (\beta \cdot S + 1)$$

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, Rk = 3)
ypr_plot_sr(population, plot_values = FALSE)
```

otherwise with a Ricker curve ($BH = 0$)

$$R = \alpha \cdot S \cdot \exp (-\beta \cdot S)$$

```{r}
population <- ypr_population_update(population, BH = 0L)
ypr_plot_sr(population, plot_values = FALSE)
```

The number of recruits at the carrying capacity ($R_\text{max}$) is a scaling constant that only affects the estimate of the yield.

Before calculating the recruitment it is important to introduce the concept of the (unfished) survivorship ($lx_a$) which is the probability of a recruit surviving to age $a$ in the absence of fish mortality.

```{r}
ypr_plot_schedule(population, "Age", "Survivorship")
```

The unfished survivorship ($lx_a$) is defined recursively by

$$lx_{R_t} = 1, lx_a = lx_{a-1} \cdot (1-N_{a-1}) \;\text{for}\; a > R_t$$
where $N_a$ is the annual interval natural mortality at age $a$.

And the fished survivorship ($lx_a^F$) is

$$lx_{R_t}^F = 1, lx_a^F = lx_{a-1}^F \cdot (1 - (1 - N_{a-1}) \cdot (1 - U_{a-1})) \;\text{for}\; a > R_t$$

The number of eggs deposited per (unfished) recruit ($\phi$) is then just

$$\phi = \sum_{a = R_t}^{t_\text{max}} lx_a \cdot F \cdot S/2$$
where $t_\text{max}$ is the maximum age considered (by default `r ypr_population()$tmax`) and $S$ is divided by two as the sex ratio is assumed to 1:1.

The fished equivalent is denoted $\phi_F$.

By definition 
$$\alpha = \frac{R_k}{\phi}$$

The value of $\beta$ for the Beverton-Holt curve can be found by rearranging the following formula where $R_0$ is the number of recruits at the unfished equilibrium.

$$R_0 = \frac{\alpha \cdot \phi \cdot R_0}{\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0 + 1}$$

$$\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0 + 1 = \alpha \cdot \phi$$

$$\beta = \frac{\alpha \cdot \phi - 1}{\phi \cdot R_0}$$

The equivalent equation for the Ricker curve is arrived at as follows

$$R_0 = \alpha \cdot \phi \cdot R_0 \cdot \exp (-\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0)$$

$$\frac{1}{\exp (-\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0)} = \alpha \cdot \phi$$

$$\beta \cdot \phi \cdot R_0 = \log(\alpha \cdot \phi)$$

$$\beta = \frac{\log(\alpha \cdot \phi)}{\phi \cdot R_0}$$

The number of recruits at the fished equilibrium ($R_{0F}$) can then be found for the Beverton-Holt curve as follows

$$R_{0F} = \frac{\alpha \cdot \phi_F \cdot R_{0F}}{\beta \cdot \phi_F \cdot R_{0F} + 1}$$

$$\beta \cdot \phi_F \cdot R_{0F} + 1 = \alpha \cdot \phi_F$$
$$R_{0F} = \frac{\alpha \cdot \phi_F - 1}{\beta \cdot \phi_F}$$

and for the Ricker

$$R_{0F} = \alpha \cdot \phi_F \cdot R_{0F} \cdot \exp (-\beta \cdot \phi_F \cdot R_{0F})$$

$$\frac{1}{\exp(-\beta \cdot \phi_F \cdot R_{0F})} = \alpha \cdot \phi_F$$

$$\beta \cdot \phi_F \cdot R_{0F} = \log(\alpha \cdot \phi_F)$$

$$R_{0F} = \frac{\log(\alpha \cdot \phi_F)}{\beta \cdot \phi_F}$$

Finally the estimates are rescaled so that the carrying capacity is identical to $R_\text{max}$ through the following transformations

$$    \beta = \beta \cdot \kappa / R_\text{max} $$
$$    R_0 = R_0 / \kappa \cdot R_\text{max} $$
$$    R_{0F} = R_{0F} / \kappa \cdot R_\text{max} $$

where $\kappa$, which is the carrying capacity in the original scale, is $\alpha/\beta$ for the Beverton-Holt and $\alpha/(\beta \cdot e)$ for the Ricker curve.

## Yield

When the yield is simply the number of fish caught (irrespective of the weight or whether or not its harvested) then it is given by

$$Y = \sum_{a = R_t}^{t_\text{max}} R_{0F} \cdot lx_a^F \cdot \pi \cdot V_a$$

if only harvested fish are considered it becomes

$$Y = \sum_{a = R_t}^{t_\text{max}} R_{0F} \cdot lx_a^F \cdot \pi \cdot V_a \cdot R$$

and if the total weight (in kg) is important then its 

$$Y = \sum_{a = R_t}^{t_\text{max}} R_{0F} \cdot lx_a^F \cdot \pi \cdot V_a \cdot R \cdot W_a/1000$$

and if only trophy fish are to be considered then its

$$Y = \sum_{a = R_t}^{t_\text{max}} \text{if}(La < L_y)\ 0\ \text{else}\ R_{0F} \cdot lx_a^F \cdot \pi \cdot V_a \cdot R \cdot W_a/1000$$
where $L_y$ is the minimum length of a trophy fish.

```{r}
ypr_plot_yield(population, harvest = TRUE, biomass = TRUE, Ly = 60)
ypr_tabulate_yield(population, harvest = TRUE, biomass = TRUE, Ly = 60)
```

## Efficiency

The catchability `q` indicates the probability of capture for a unit of effort ($E$).
It is assumed to be related to $\pi$ according to the relationship
$$\pi = 1 - \exp(\log(1-q)\cdot E)$$
which can be rearranged to give
$$E = \frac{\log(1-\pi)}{\log(1-q)}.$$

```{r}
ypr_plot_yield(population, y = "Effort", harvest = TRUE, biomass = TRUE, Ly = 60)
```

```{r}
ypr_plot_yield(population, y = "YPUE", harvest = TRUE, biomass = TRUE, Ly = 60)
```
